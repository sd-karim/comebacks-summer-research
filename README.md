# INCOMPLETE - Comebacks in Sports: Baseball and the Home Team Advantage 

## Overview
This repository contains the process code and results of my summer research as a part of a sports psychology study on comebacks in sports. I chose to focus on home team advantage, because in the literature review part of this study, I read that the home team advantage doesn't have as great of an effect on baseball as it does other team sports, due to baseball being made up of more individual actions than those sports. The goal of this project was to examine if a home team advantage could be observed in a sample of games, in terms of making comebacks (ie, are home teams less likely to be in a position to need to make the comeback? when in that position, do they complete the comeback more frequently than the away team?).
